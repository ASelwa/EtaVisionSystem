To add a variable to display onto the screen:

1. Define an ID in OSD_SLIP.h and in HPV_ArduinoMega
2. Perform calculations/read from ANT in main loop of HPV_ArduinoMega
3. Send value in main loop via SlipPacketSend
4. Add an extern variable declaration in OSD_SLIP.cpp
5. Add the regular variable declaration in HPV_OSD
6. Add a case to OSD_SLIP.cpp to extract the value from the buffer and assign it to the variable from steps 4/5
7. Add a panel function to OSD_panels_HPV
8. Call the function in writePanels() (also located in OSD_panels_HPV)
